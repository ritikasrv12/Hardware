# Hardware
Introduction:
Farmers worldwide face challenges with inefficient irrigation systems leading to water wastage and decreased profits. Traditional systems lack the ability to measure farm conditions, causing over-watering and under-watering. The Smart Irrigation System (SIS) addresses these issues, aiming to provide a solution to water inefficiency.

Objectives:
The project's objective is to design a simple methodology using soil moisture sensors to monitor and control soil moisture continuously, optimizing irrigation resources. Additionally, the system checks methane levels in the soil, focusing on measuring soil moisture and methane gas.

Literature Review:
The implementation of a Smart Sprinkler (SSP) system, consisting of microcontrollers, sensors, and a decision-making system, is discussed. The SSP uses environmental data to determine irrigation needs, employing a truth table based on temperature and moisture sensor parameters. The integrated system improves water-energy efficiency.

Components:
The system incorporates components such as soil moisture sensors, methane sensors (MQ-4), Arduino Uno, DHT11 sensor, DC water pump, battery, LCD display, and various accessories.

Practical Implementation:
The smart irrigation system adapts to weather conditions, senses soil moisture, and operates the water pump accordingly. It enables remote water flow management, displays soil moisture data on an LCD, and ensures efficient water application.

Results and Discussion:
The system's sensors enable remote monitoring, contributing to a smart farm. Readings from soil moisture sensors are transmitted to an online database, displaying moisture content in soil categories. The system effectively prevents over-irrigation.

Future Scope:
Smart irrigation systems are crucial for modern agriculture, offering increased production in less time. The fully automated system minimizes manual handling, providing a comfortable solution for farmers in the face of climate changes.

Conclusion:
The designed system effectively monitors soil moisture levels, automating the irrigation process and preventing crop damage. The integration of IoT and automation shows potential for considerable development in farming by efficiently utilizing water resources.![Screenshot (343)](https://github.com/ritikasrv12/Hardware/assets/105850960/0ee704ab-8517-401a-a3f3-9b9470c13ee6)
