# Smart Street Lighting System
This project presents an energy-efficient Smart Street Lighting System utilizing Arduino, LEDs, and various sensors. Traditional street lighting systems are manually controlled and often lead to energy wastage. This system automates streetlight operation by integrating Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and Infrared (IR) sensors. The LDR detects ambient light levels to ensure lights are only active during the night, while the IR sensors detect vehicle movement, dynamically adjusting light intensity to reduce power consumption. LEDs allow for precise intensity control and longer life, contributing to significant energy savings of 50-75% compared to conventional street lights. The system also includes speed detection to warn citizens of approaching high-speed vehicles. This smart lighting solution optimizes energy use, reduces maintenance costs, and minimizes light pollution.

# Summary
The intensity of a Street light increases when a vehicle passes through a streetlight, when the sensor detects the car, Arduino increases the intensity of the light and when a vehicle passes, the intensity automatically decreases after a few seconds. The system senses vehicle movement using IR and switches on lights only when needed at night when a vehicle passes by. Otherwise, the lights are switched off when not required. It also uses IR sensors to detect vehicles coming at a high speed and sends off an alarm to warn people.
